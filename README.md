# TO-DO Task Organization for Dwelling Optimization

TO-DO is a task-tracking Flask app for communicating status of shared tasks within a household. Members of a household can assign themselves or other housemates a task, track completion of tasks, visualize each member's contributions utilizing Chart JS, and send text reminders with Twilio SMS.

TO-DO is a web app created by Erin Dunkley. As a full-time working mom, Erin wanted to create a convenient tool for checking the status of commonly shared household tasks and communicating status between household members.
